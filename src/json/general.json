For example, the hybridization of the carbon atoms in ethene (C2H4) is sp2, which leads to the formation of a double bond between the two carbon atoms. This double bond is shorter and stronger than a single bond, and the molecule is therefore more reactive than a molecule with only single bonds.

    "What is sp3 hybridization": [
      "In sp3 hybridization, the s orbital and three p orbitals of an atom combine to form four hybridized orbitals that are all equivalent in shape and energy. This type of hybridization is commonly found in organic molecules with tetrahedral geometry, such as methane (CH4) and ethane (C2H6). The carbon atom in methane, for example, is sp3 hybridized, which allows it to form four covalent bonds with the four hydrogen atoms in a tetrahedral arrangement.",
      "Sp3 hybridization is a type of hybridization that occurs when an atom's s orbital and three of its p orbitals combine to form four new hybrid orbitals with equal energy and shape. These hybrid orbitals point towards the corners of a tetrahedron, making them ideal for molecules with a tetrahedral shape. An example of an sp3-hybridized molecule is ammonia (NH3), where the nitrogen atom is sp3 hybridized and forms three covalent bonds with hydrogen atoms and a lone pair of electrons.",
      "Sp3 hybridization is a process in which an atom's s orbital and three of its p orbitals combine to form four hybrid orbitals that have equal energy and shape. These hybrid orbitals are arranged in a tetrahedral geometry around the central atom and can participate in bonding with other atoms. One common example of sp3 hybridization is in the carbon atom of alkanes, which are hydrocarbons with single bonds between the carbon atoms. In alkanes, each carbon atom is sp3 hybridized and is bonded to four other atoms, including other carbon atoms."
