In 2022, the company had the most worldwide sales of battery electric vehicles, capturing 18% of the market. <br/><br/> Tesla was founded in 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning. In 2004, Elon Musk joined the company as chairman and product architect. Musk became CEO in 2008. Tesla's first product was the Roadster, a sports car that was produced from 2008 to 2012. The company's second product was the Model S, a luxury sedan that was produced from 2012 to 2022. The Model S was followed by the Model X, an SUV that was produced from 2015 to 2022. In 2017, Tesla released the Model 3, a mass-market sedan. The Model 3 was followed by the Model Y, a crossover SUV that was produced from 2020 to present.

    query: ["What is hybridization?", "explain hybridisation"],
    response: [
      "Hybridization is a concept in chemistry that describes how atomic orbitals combine to form new orbitals with different shapes and energies. The new orbitals are called hybrid orbitals, and they are used to form chemical bonds between atoms. <br/><br/> The most common type of hybridization is sp3 hybridization. In sp3 hybridization, one s orbital and three p orbitals on an atom combine to form four new hybrid orbitals that are directed towards the corners of a tetrahedron. This type of hybridization is found in methane (CH4), where the carbon atom is sp3 hybridized and forms four bonds with hydrogen atoms. <br/><br/> Other types of hybridization include sp2 hybridization, sp hybridization, and d-orbital hybridization. In sp2 hybridization, one s orbital and two p orbitals on an atom combine to form three new hybrid orbitals that are directed towards the corners of an equilateral triangle. This type of hybridization is found in ethylene (C2H4), where the carbon atoms are sp2 hybridized and form three bonds with hydrogen atoms and one bond with each other. <br/><br/> In sp hybridization, one s orbital and one p orbital on an atom combine to form two new hybrid orbitals that are oriented 180 degrees apart. This type of hybridization is found in beryllium chloride (BeCl2), where the beryllium atom is sp hybridized and forms two bonds with chlorine atoms. <br/><br/> D-orbital hybridization can occur when an atom has d orbitals. In d-orbital hybridization, one s orbital and three p orbitals on an atom combine with one or more d orbitals to form five or six new hybrid orbitals. This type of hybridization is found in transition metals, such as iron (Fe). <br/><br/> Hybridization is a useful concept in chemistry because it can help us to predict the shape of molecules and the strength of chemical bonds.
