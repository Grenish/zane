ZANE is a chatbot application developed by Grenish Rai, a single developer. It is designed to respond to user input and provide information on various topics, including science, technology, history, and more. ZANE is built using React.js and utilizes data from JSON files to provide responses to user queries. It is designed to be user-friendly, with a simple and intuitive interface that allows users to type in their questions and receive immediate responses. ZANE also includes a fallback feature that responds with a pre-set message if it does not have a specific response to a user's question. Overall, ZANE is a helpful tool for anyone seeking quick and reliable answers to their questions.

ZANE version 1 is a great chatbot that has a basic set of questions and answers related to various topics. It is designed to help users get quick answers to their questions in a conversational and user-friendly way. However, ZANE version 2 is coming with exciting new features.

One of the main features of ZANE version 2 is the introduction of a dark mode, which is perfect for users who prefer a more subdued and less bright user interface. The new update will also have a feedback form to help users provide feedback, ask questions, and report issues they encounter while using the chatbot.

ZANE version 2 will also include typing animations that simulate a real conversation between the user and the chatbot. This feature will make the conversation more engaging and interactive.

Another significant improvement in ZANE version 2 is the implementation of auto-scroll, which will help users navigate the chat history with ease. This feature will come in handy when the chat history is long and requires scrolling to access past conversations.

Lastly, the new update will have a huge database of questions and answers covering more topics and with more specific and accurate answers. With all these features, ZANE version 2 promises to be an even better and more user-friendly chatbot than the current version.
